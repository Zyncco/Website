  about: >
    I am currently a Canadian software engineer and have been programming for
    6 years. Although I've stuck my hand into a bit of everything, my expertise
    is primarily using JVM-based languages for backend infrastructure. Outside
    of computer science, I love writing, talking in front of large groups and
    exploring Vancouver.
